##Changing Astrocyte Energy

Astrocyte energy availability limits can be changed by typing a value into the box in the control panel or by dragging and moving the slider.

>_Astrocyte max energy_
>_Astrocyte min energy_

Currently, any change in energy levels does not take effect until the current signal has completely died and the network is reset.
