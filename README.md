##Modifications during simulation

###Changing Astrocyte Energy

Astrocyte energy availability limits can be changed by typing a value into the box in the control panel or by dragging and moving the slider.

>_Astrocyte max energy_

>_Astrocyte min energy_

Currently, any change in energy levels does not take effect until the current signal has completely died and the network is reset.

###Non-functional changes

Changing any of the following attributes will have no affect on network functionality:
- Neuron Size
- Neuron Opacity
- Axon Opacity Mult
- Signal Color
- Neuron Color
- Axon Color
- Background
